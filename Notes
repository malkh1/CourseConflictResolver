-------------------------- Notes for Parsing --------------------------------

!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!

Make sure all filtering is done by COLUMN NAME and not COLUMN POSITION

ASSUMPTIONS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

- The file format for course information will remain as an excel sheet.
- Only some columns from the excel sheet will be considered for scalability.

Discussion to plan out how excel data will be parsed, organized, and implemented.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT

- Have a system that checks course schedules against school's overall schedule

We will create one database table that holds all data in provided excel sheet. This will be done
using APACHE POI, and a parsing script to add contents to database.

A hashmap will be used to store column name data and position. This is preferable over a list
approach to avoid having to iterate through the entire list to locate a specific cell.

The parser must be constructed in a manner that allows to continue functioning properly in case
new columns are added or existing columns are removed.

Filter to parse only required columns committed and pushed.

Discussed the CourseRecordsRepository Class.
Entries may be redundant. Will come back to it later.
