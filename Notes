Discussion to plan out how excel data will be parsed, organized, and implemented.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT

- Have a system that checks course schedules against school's overall schedule

We will create one database table that holds all data in provided excel sheet. This will be done
using APACHE POI, and a parsing script to add contents to database.

A hashmap will be used to store column name data and position. This is preferable over a list
approach to avoid having to iterate through the entire list to locate a specific cell.

The parser must be constructed in a manner that allows to continue functioning properly in case
new columns are added or existing columns are removed.
